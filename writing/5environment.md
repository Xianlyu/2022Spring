A healthy environment is the prerequisite of further development. 

1. Without making every effort to protect it, there exists the possibility that the quality of life would drop immensely. If political leaders cannot enact efficient policies such as limitations towards industrial emission, living surroundings will get increasingly harmful. 

2. For one thing, exhaust gas emitted by factories and private cars intensifies haze in large cities. As a result, citizens are more likely to have respiratory diseases such as **cough** and **pneumonia**. 

3. For another, waste water makes condition worse as it pollutes drinking water. What's more, it exposes potential dangerous conditions in which the land would lose fertility and chemical elements would destabilize the eco-system. 

   There is every reason to believe that both people and eco-system benefit from using clean energy.
