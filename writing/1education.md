# 教育类

以下话题虽然可能和教育没什么关系。

## 旅游

1. broaden our horizons -> have a thorough understanding of various history & culture in tourist attractions. -> stepping on tourist attractions in person can one fully immerse himself in its real cultural surroundings 
2. have access to different ways of thinking through communicating with local residents from different backgrounds. 

## 放松

1. 人们总是overwork frequently & keep sedentary in the office for a long time -> relax body, stretch out their arms & legs,
2. relax their muscles -> relieve mental stress -> conducive to forget troubles & cheer up. 

## 交朋友

1. keep in touch with each other in the daily life & even entertain together to enjoy their life.
2. individuals excel in different fields like subjects or methods of study -> learning strengths from others -> make up for weaknesses & solve a variety of problems. 

## 一起学习

1.  form a constructive study atmosphere. 遇到困难有人帮忙一起解决； 不容易沉迷游戏
2. master more solid knowledge & skills. 遇到问题只是自己解决->浪费时间;  可以学到不同的方法 (learn different methods & weigh advantages and disadvantages of them).
